vkBeautify SQL parser covers only SELECT statement as most javascript developers most time have deal with SELECT. 
As SQL syntax itself is very large and complex, some complex statements can be formatted not as perfect as you'd 
make it manually. But anyway, this tool helps you to save time on reading unformatted SQL statement.

<span style="font-size:80%">"Preserve Comments" is not implemented for SQL part or the application. </span>
