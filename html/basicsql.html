<p>This is an example of a SQL statement.</p>

vkBeautify SQL parser covers only SELECT statement as most javascript developers have deal with SELECT-based queries. 
As SELECT syntax itself is very large and flexible, some complex nested statements can be formatted not as perfect as you'd 
make it manually. But anyway, it helps you to save time on reading unformatted SQL statement.

<p>Click on "<b>Minify</b>" button to minify the text (not sure if anybody needs it, but I keep it for consistency :)<br/><br/>
<span style="font-size:80%">"Preserve Comments" is not implemented for SQL part of the application. </span>
