<p>Click on "<b>Minify</b>" button to minify the text. </p>
<p>
Check "<b>Preserve Comments</b>" box if you want to keep comments. Or uncheck it

as pattern characters. 
There are 2 ways to customize indent pattern: 
<ul><li>
set number of white spaces as numeric value:<br/> 2, 4, etc.<br/> 
</li><li>
set desired pattern as a string, for example:<br/>
<b>'. . . .'</b><br/>
<b>'____'</b><br/>
<b>'- - - -'</b><br/>
<b>'&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'</b>&nbsp; - &nbsp;string of white spaces is also valid.<br/>
</li></ul>
<b>Note:</b> <i>minify() function works only with whitespace pattern.</i>
